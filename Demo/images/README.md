The *images.go* file is auto-generated by [go-resources](https://github.com/omeid/go-resources/),
which can be obtained by doing this:

```
go get -u github.com/omeid/go-resources/cmd/resources
```

Once you have it installed, you create images.go by doing this:

```
resources -declare=true -output="images.go" -package="images" *.png
```
