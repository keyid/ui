The **images.go** file is auto-generated by [go-resources](https://github.com/omeid/go-resources/),
which can be installed with:

```
go get -u github.com/omeid/go-resources/cmd/resources
```

Once you have it installed, you create **images.go** with:

```
resources -declare=true -output="images.go" -package="images" *.png *.jpg
```
