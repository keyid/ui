# go-ui
A user interface for Go.

This is very much a work in progress. At present, this code only runs on the Mac. Over time, I
hope to add support for Windows and Linux as well.

Widgets that have been implemented:

- Button
- CheckBox
- ImageButton
- Label
- Menu (including a global menu bar)
- RadioButton
- Separator
- Window

Widgets that still need to be implemented:

- ColorChooser
- Dialog
- FileChooser
- List
- PopupMenu
- ProgressBar
- ScrollBar
- Slider
- SplitPanel
- Table
- TabPanel
- TextArea
- TextField
- ToolBar
- Tree
